    "We will build a very simple discrete-time model of **congestion** in a warehouse,\n",

    "At each time period (for example, one hour or one day):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some number of jobs arrive (trucks, containers, orders, etc.).\n",
    "- The system has a fixed **capacity**: the maximum number of jobs that can be processed.\n",
    "- If arrivals exceed capacity, the extra jobs wait in a **queue**.\n",
    "- We track how the queue evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build the simulator in four stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Session 1:** Understand the story and choose data structures.\n",
    "2. **Session 2:** Implement a simple deterministic queue evolution with loops.\n",
    "3. **Session 3:** Add randomness and wrap the logic into functions.\n",
    "4. **Session 4:** Save results to a CSV file and make basic plots.\n"

    "### Informal story\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a warehouse dock, a cross-dock platform, or a port terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trucks / containers / jobs **arrive** over time.\n",
    "- The facility can process only a limited number per period (capacity).\n",
    "- Unprocessed jobs wait in a **queue** for the next period.\n",
    "- If arrivals are often larger than capacity, the queue can grow a lot (congestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate this in **discrete time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At each period:\n",
    "  - New arrivals come in.\n",
    "  - The system processes up to `capacity` jobs.\n",
    "  - We update the number of jobs in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to think about\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How would you store the queue length at each period?  \n",
    "2. How would you store the number of arrivals per period?  \n",
    "3. What performance measures could be interesting?\n",
    "   - maximum queue length,\n",
    "   - average queue length,\n",
    "   - number of periods with \"severe congestion\" (queue above some threshold).\n",

    "You can discuss this with a partner or write your ideas in a text cell.\n"
