    "- A warehouse holds inventory of a product.\n",
    "- Every day there is some random **demand**.\n",

    "- We want to simulate this system over many days and see how inventory evolves.\n",

    "1. **Session 1:** Think about data types and how to represent the problem.\n",
    "2. **Session 2:** Write the core daily update loop.\n",
    "3. **Session 3:** Turn the logic into reusable functions and add randomness.\n",
